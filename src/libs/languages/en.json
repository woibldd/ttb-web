Therefore, the miner needs a BTC futures contract to stablize his income.。<br></p><p> For example: Current price of BTC = USD500 / token. BTC futures contract price = USD500 / contract. The income that the miner wants to stablize = 10BTC * USD500 = USD5,000,Face value of a BTC futures contract = USD100.

The number of BTC the miner would be able to sell = 10 - 1.6667 = 8.3333 BTC.
